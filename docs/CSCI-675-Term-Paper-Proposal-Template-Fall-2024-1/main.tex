\begin{abstract}
Our project aims to develop a machine learning model that utilizes image frames to detect falls in real-time. We will be leveraging the URFD dataset, which provides video frames labeled for fall and non-fall instances, to create a reliable and efficient fall detection system.

\section{Introduction/Motivation}
Falls among the elderly, either at their residence, or a care center, are a significant health and safety concern, often leading to severe injuries and decreased quality of life. The goal of our project is to develop a machine learning-based fall detection system that can improve response times in emergencies. By focusing solely on image frames from the rich URFD dataset, we intend to create a robust model capable of accurately classifying fall and non-fall instances.

\section{Baseline or Initial Experiments}
To start, we will conduct exploratory data analysis on the URFD dataset to understand how the fall and non-fall instances are distributed. Our initial experiments will involve training a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on static images to establish a baseline for our model's performance. We will evaluate the model's performance on accuracy and loss metrics to ensure a solid foundation for further development.

\section{Final Experiments}
After establishing our baseline, we will extend our approach by implementing a more complex CNN architecture that can effectively leverage the visual information present in the images. Our final evaluation will focus on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to assess the modelâ€™s performance. We will also experiment with data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of our model.

\section{Final Goals \& Evaluation}
By the end of the semester, we hope to achieve a functional fall detection model that performs with at least 85\% accuracy on the validation set. We will evaluate our experiments based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of our model's performance. We plan to report our results on both baseline and advanced models, targeting a more ambitious outcome for the latter.

\section{Related Work}
Previous studies have explored various approaches to fall detection using computer vision and machine learning. For instance, [Author, Year] discusses the use of CNNs for image-based fall detection, highlighting the importance of temporal information. [Another Author, Year] examines the impact of feature engineering in improving model performance for similar tasks. These works will guide our methodology and help refine our approach.

\section{Data \& Technical Requirements}
We will utilize the URFD dataset, which contains images labeled for fall and non-fall instances. The primary software libraries will include TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development, along with pandas for data manipulation and OpenCV for image processing. Access to a GPU-enabled environment (such as Google Colab) will also be beneficial for training our models.
